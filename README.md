The main issue I came across when completing this assignment was accomplishing the banner image overlay. I managed to find a solution that produced a similar effect but not exact to the mockup. 
  
I used the following resources for this assignment:
* [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/)  
    Used for general Bootstrap troubleshooting
* [LESS Documentation](http://lesscss.org/#)  
    Used for general LESS troubleshooting  
* [Bootstrap Creative](https://bootstrapcreative.com/bootstrap-push-pull-column-ordering-tutorial/)  
    Used to find out how rearrange the order of the items in the first section between mobile and desktop views
* [Bootsnipp](https://bootsnipp.com/snippets/eNxGv)  
    Used to find a solution to the banner image overlay
